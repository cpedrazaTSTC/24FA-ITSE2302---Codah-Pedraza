							<p>As of today, I'm a sophomore in high school at South Texas ISD's Science Academy.
								Some notable achievements would be that I've kept straight A's and masters on state 
								assessments for a couple years now. Along with this, I've been in the PTECH program 
								since freshman year. I've had my ups and downs throughout the course, but at the end of
								the day its the career path I plan to fulfill as I inch closer to graduation. During senior
								year, we uphold an annual Engineering Design and Development event where all the seniors
								test and formulate a capstone project in correlation to solving a real-world problem. I
								intend to carry this out with my knowledge on computer science. Its all still to be determined, but
								with the use of Python and sensors, I could create a robot that could determine the 
								difference between recyclable elements and trash. Usually, the winner of the competition is awarded
								with a scholarship and prize money. However, I still have time to truly decide on what I aspire to 
								do during that time period.

						<h2>How Did I Get Into Coding?</h2>
					</div>
					<!-- page information -->
					<div class="section-contents">
						<div class="section-paragraph">
							<p>Since I was a young boy, technology has always been a distinct passion of mine, specifically
								coding. I've always wondered what happened behind a TV screen or phone, and how it contributed to
								its functionality. It was up until a couple years ago when I decided to finally answer that question.
								I first started coding in Python because it appeared straightforward, but now I'm familiar with various
								languages. These include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, C, and some CPP. Although C and CPP are equally 
								as important as the others, I want to explore different scenarios and acquire new information from the
								languages we're learning today.
