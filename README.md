This repository includes a project containing my academic timeline in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To run the code, download "Live Server" from VSCode extensions and initiate the process in the bottom right corner if done correctly. The main purpose of the repository is to collaborate and share files between individuals.
Additionally, the code is labeled with comments on all files. The comments describe the thought process and logic behind the instructed code. If you plan to execute the JavaScript files under its relative folder, make sure you have a compiler installed and functional. When searched from the extensions tab, a popular compiler such as CodeRunner works exceptionally well
for running many languages including JavaScript, CPP, C, and Python.
